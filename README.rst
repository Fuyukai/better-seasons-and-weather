Better Seasons and Weather
--------------------------

BSAW is a mod for Fabric 1.15+ that provides global overworld seasons and weathers.  All biomes
have their own per-day, per-season temperature which affect the player and blocks.

Features
========

- 4 seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)
    - 30 days each.

- Biomes now have a varying temperature, affected by season and time of day.

- Players now have their own internal temperature; don't stay in the cold/hot too long!

- Snow falls globally in the winter.
    - Snow also melts layer-by-layer on warm days instead of all at once by light.

Biome tweaks
============

 - All "hot" biomes now get very, very cold in the winter. Don't be out too long!
